# Multi-Class-Image-Classification-on-CIFAR-Subset-Using-CNN

This project shows how to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from a subset of the CIFAR dataset.

## Dataset
The CIFAR dataset is a collection of 60,000 color images, each 32x32 pixels, in 10 different classes (like airplane, car, bird, etc.). In this notebook, I use only a subset of the CIFAR dataset (4 classes).
